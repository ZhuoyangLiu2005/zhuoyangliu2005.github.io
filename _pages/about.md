## HybridVLA: Collaborative Autoregression and Diffusion in a Unified Vision-Language-Action Model
![hybridvla_teaser](images/hybridvla_teaser_0520.png)
We introduce HybridVLA, a unified framework that absorbs the continuous nature of diffusion-based actions and the contextual reasoning of autoregression within a single large language model. To mitigate interference between the two generation paradigms, we propose a collaborative training recipe that seamlessly incorporates diffusion denoising into the next-token prediction process. With this recipe, we find these two action prediction methods not only reinforce each other but also exhibit varying strength across different tasks. Therefore, we design a collaborative action ensemble mechanism that adaptively fuses both predictions, leading to more robust control. HybridVLA outperforms previous state-of-the-art VLA methods by 14% and 19% in mean success rate on simulation and real-world tasks, respectively, while demonstrating stable manipulation in unseen configurations.
